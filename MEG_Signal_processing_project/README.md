# What is MEG:

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a functional neuroimaging technique for mapping brain activity by recording magnetic fields produced by electrical currents occurring naturally in the brain, using very sensitive magnetometers. Arrays of SQUIDs (superconducting quantum interference devices) are currently the most common magnetometer.

# The Experimental Aims:

Detection of objective neural signatures for the integration of visual information in the visual cortex of humans. 
Studying the Interplay between gamma band harmonics in generating oscillatory inter- modulation in the visual cortex. 
Allows use to anwser the question of how the brain combines information to form higher level representations that represents
a gestalt or global understanding of sub-units of information.
